## Features
- To use the backend feature, you need to have Postman installed from www.postman.com.
### Create task
1. In Postman, find the box with the phrase: ***Enter URL or paste text***.
2. Paste the link: ```http://localhost:<your_server_port_number>/task/create```.
3. Select **POST** method.
4. Under the box select ***Body*** and check the ***raw*** option. From the dropdown list select ***JSON***.
5. Below in the window you can paste this sample data:
```json
{
    "title": "Example task",
    "description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.",
    "status": "pending"
}
```
After pressing the **Send** button you should see:
```json
{
"title": "Example task",
"description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.",
"status": "pending",
"_id": "number_of_task_id",
"createdAt": "date_and_time_of_creation",
"__v": 0
}
```

### Show all tasks
1. Find the box with phrase: ***Enter URL or paste text*** and paste: ```http://localhost:<your_server_port_number>/task/show-all```.
2. Select **GET** method.
3. After pressing the **Send** button you should see:
```json
{
    "totalTasks": 1,
    "currentPage": 1,
    "totalPages": 1,

        {
            "_id": "number_of_task_id",
            "title": "Example task",

}
```

### Show tasks with a given status
